            <h3><strong>Benefits of using GitHub</strong></h3>
      
<br><hr><br>

          <p>One big benefit to using Git is that you can collaborate on projects through one channel (repository) with which whenever changes are made to the project, Git will keep track of all changes made so no work is lost. People in different areas would also be able to work on the same project through cloning and creating their own local repositories in which the changes can be committed to the central repository and saved in its history so everyone can still see them.
             Another benefit is the pull requests feature on Git which acts as a commenting feature just like on a text editor where you can comment your code without messing up the code. Pull requests is another way of allowing other designers that are working on the same project through different repositories to help on any difficulties you might be having in your code through means of merging one of your branches into their repository.
             Git is very beneficial especially for UX designers where prototyping Is a big part of their job. The ability to create different branches creates individual areas In which the designer can create different prototypes of the final product, almost like wireframing a website. These protypes will work just like the real product making it beneficial for prototyping as the designer can see how different changes/approaches affect it whilst avoiding the breakage of the actual code (for the final product). Presenting these prototypes to someone is as easy as telling them the branch names they were done under and it can be checked out.
             In summary, Git is just a very useful platform to conduct group websites as information can be saved and shared easily and efficiently saving designers valuable time worrying about eerors in code or working on one website using multiple devices in different places, etc and can devote all their much needed time on making the website.

	        <h3><strong>LawsofUX.com</strong></h3>

         <p>
			 This is a website that i got introduced t last year in my first year interaction design class and is basically a website that lists in detail all the princpals involved with empathetic user experience design. This want a mandatory website to use in assignments is this course but i have particularly found it useful to refer to in all my work as it helps improve and enhance my designs through making it more user-centric and presentable. There are overall 20 laws in which refers to different aspects of UX design elements that points toward userbility/functionality and readability which both aim at establishing certain deisgn guidelines that when followed exactly, allows for user attractability and better outcomes for the website. I could definetly see the difference in the websites that i have created through using this website rather than just basing my designs of precedents and not studying the designs indepth. I would definetly recommend this website to not only UX students, but also UX designers and potentially UX busineeses as these law are very important and useful and will have a positive impact on the designs created in an empatheic way that will enhance the experience users have in every element of the website, provided you use the laws in the right way which the website explains each law indepth (as i said before) so you know exactly when and how to implement them. 
		 <br>
		 Below in the slideshow include the principals which ive implemented, in reference from this website, the most in my work for this course. To find out more about these prinipals and/or to get information an all 20 principals, click <a href="https://lawsofux.com/"><em><strong>HERE!!</strong></em></a>

		<h3><strong>Figma Userbility</strong></h3>

		<br><hr><br>

		<p>Figma is a wireframing app at which you are also able to create interactive working prototypes of websites with the various amounts of tools and options they have at hand. This is a website that we used throughout this course several times especially in the last two projects and really came in handy when working with a team especially with the added benefit of being able to create several different workspaces and have a large surefaec area in which to work in each workspace. Figma is very effiecient to use as you could create wreframes in a simplistic and organzied way that allows you to be able to code efficiently based on what you have created on figma (with some bits of code already being provided by figma based on the elements you have added to the designs). Figma is defienetly a tool that i have enjoyed using and will continue to use theoughout my design career as i am used to it and its fast effiencecy of being able to plan out wirefranes makes it a winner.</p>
