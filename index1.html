		<h3>Blog wireframes</h3>
		
		<h2>Blockframes</h2>
		<p>My first step to the creation of my blog was to design some potential blockframes in order to just roughly see how my website would look interms of where divs would go and how i could consider putting the elements in certain positions on the page. The benefit to doing this step before any other wireframing is to understand and visualize how content would be positioned so it can be easier to create low-fidelity wireframes which is next.</p>

		    <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>The next step in my design process was low-fidelity wireframes which i added actual header and div names with the added annotations so that i could more contextually visualize what content would go in which divs where the were positioned which is what i had already completed and planned in the blockframing process.</p>

			<h2>High-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        	<p> The last step of my wireframing process was to complete some high-fidelity wireframes which is the next step after low-fidelity as this step is to add my proposed content to th correct positions that i planned in the previous wireframes. This is where i could completely visualize how my website is going to look before the next step which is actually to start coding. I had made a couple of minor changes to the layout in my high-fidelity wireframes which were inclusive of my Navbar and the sizing of my elements as doing these specific wireframes made me realize that elements need to adapt for presentability when the actual elements are added.</p>

           <h2>Techniques used in Blog Design</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Nav bar - Simple layout and kept in top right of header div (to implement Jakob’s law) making it easier for users to navigate themselves around the website as most websites put the navbar here. I also added a background color and a text color to the navbar on hover so that it gives the users an extra obvious signal about which link they are clicking and when the link has actually been clicked.</li><br>

				<li>Images/video - Adding a “title text” attribute in order to make images and video accessible to even users with disabilities (considering ethics) (users with vision disabilities when using screen readers will enable all the images/videos to be read out aloud to the user by the computer as to what the are.</li><br>

				<li>Balance - Tried keeping a balance between text and image on each page so users wont get bored reading too much of one or the either.</li><br>
					
				<li>Alignment - Aligned the elements in each section with each other whilst also aligning the header and footer elements with each other in order to maintain a high presentability.  Aligned text on every page to the left to keep text layout consistent throughout each page and help it complement the centre align of the image and subheader whilst also fitting presentably between the section div.</li> <br>

			    <li>Proximity - Kept all elements on each page relatively close to each other but at a suffiecient enough gap so they can be distinctive but still relate to each other on the page so users can make the connections within elements and their details whilst in the process, not getting confused reading cluttered information (Implementing the law of proximity)</li><br>

			    <li>Contrast - Chose a color scheme of orange grey and white for the backgrounds of the divs which i chose based on the fact that they contrast well with each other and also help compliment and make the black colour of the text stand out more to readers enhancing readability. Through this process i was also trying to implement the aesthetic usability effect which would make users be more attracted to my website and use it more than other potential blogs. Didnt choose too many colors to overpresent the website and turn the attention away from the information.</li><br>

			    <li>Elements - Tried not to add too many elements on each page which may cause users to be stressed/or confused as to where or what to read (implementing Hick’s Law) as i wanted to make the reading process an easy flow of movement for users.</li>	<br>

		        <li>Images - I took all photos into photoshop and reduced the resolution in order to decrease the file size of the image (Implementing the law of Doherty Threshold) so the website would load fast, making users stay on it without frustrations.</li><br>

				<li>Images - Also add opacity on hover so users can know that the image is able to be clicked to see an enlarged version of it. </li><br>
				
				<li>Slideshow - Along with the clickability of the images, i also added a slideshow at the bottom of the homepage in order to make my website more engaging and interesting through the use of interactive elements like the controlability of the videos as well in order to build a better relationship between the user and the website which in turn will cause them to use my website for larger periods of time.</li>

		        <li> Repition - Repeated layouts, fonts, and color throughout each page in order to keep reading processes the same for users and keeping the consistency of the originality of theme of my website.</li><br>

	            <li> Typography - For all the text in my website, I used the Open Sans font as through research, i found that one of the best fonts to use for a blog type of website is Open Sans, and i kept this consistent throughout each page to maintain the theme.</li><br>
	        </ul>

		   <h3>Website Emulation Tutorial</h3>

              <img src="img/wwf.JPG" style="height: 700px;  width: 1500px; margin-left: -252px; padding-top: 10px;" title="Picture of World Wildlife Fund website"> 
<br><br><hr><br>
      <p>For my first blog post, I chose to emulate the World Wildlife Fund website in my way through a more simplified bit of code and design in which it doesnt look exactly like the actual website. Too code for this website, i first looked at the actual websites code (inspect element) and saw how they structured and used css to design the layout for thier website which i took and adapted of to make my mimiced one. This is my process below.</p>
<br><br>

  	<div id="scn1">  
		<a href="img/scn1.png">
		<img  src="img/scn1.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="First step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text1">
		<em>Before i started to code the major bits of this website, i first stareted by codig the basic bits which was just the original box model for which would hold the content for my website..</em>
    </div>
<br><br>

    <div id="scn2">  
		<a href="img/scn2.png">
		<img  src="img/scn2.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="Second step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text2">
		<em>After building my box model for the layout, i started by going from top to bottom of the wwf website and trying to construct its elements. For the slideshow there was two parts in which the first part i just made the dic, added the images and postitioned the slideshow.</em>
    </div>
<br><br>
    
    <div id="scn3">  
		<a href="img/scn3.png">
		<img  src="img/scn3.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="Third step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text3">
		<em>Part 2 of making the slideshow consisted of me having to style the slideshow and use a script in which the jquey slidehsow needs to transition and run. I did this by going to w3 schools and finding the javascript files for the slideshow in which there was two - one that needed to be saved as a separate Js file (and added to the html page), and one that provided a whole script for the slideshow to run which i linked to my slideshow using the script src tag.</em>
    </div>
<br><br>

    <div id="scn4">  
		<a href="img/scn4.png">
		<img  src="img/scn4.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="Fourth step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text4">
		<em>After the slideshow, i went on to the body of the page in which i created the links used to go to inter wwf pages. Again i started by first making a separate div for this section and also made separate divs for each image so i could position them in the right way without contradiction.</em>
    </div>
<br><br>
    
    <div id="scn5">  
		<a href="img/scn5.png">
		<img  src="img/scn5.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="Fifth step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text5">
		<em>I then went on to create the links for the images which i displayed above them like the wwf website did. to make it more obvious they were links, i added a hover decoration of underline in which helps the user know that it is a clickable link.</em>
    </div>
<br><br>
    
    <div id="scn6">  
		<a href="img/scn6.png">
		<img  src="img/scn6.png" style="width:200px; height:150px; border-radius: 10px;" title="Final step of creation"> 
		</a>		
	</div>
	<div id="text6">
		<em>After building the element above for my website, doing this part was fairly easy in which i follwed the same process and techniques to build the news articles however i also added an opacity element to make sure users lso know that the articles are clickable. I also had to figure out how to make the text appear on the image and i did this by changing the z-index (acts as 'bring to front') and changed the position of relative and absolute so the text can be seen before the image.</em>

	         <h3>Flexbox Tutorial</h3>

	         <p>In this turorial, the aim was to learn how to use a CSS attribute called Flexbox which helps a lot in helping to align, size, and proximise certain elements in a more methodical process in which allows the efficiency in coding the certain section. I particularly found this very useful in the creation of this blog as i had to display lots of content and using it has saved me time having to try and organize all the information and keep it presentable.</p>

	         <h3>Javascript Baby Steps Tutorial</h3>

	         <p>This tutorial was all about learning basic Javascripting skills which involved learning how to make a button function to make a certain type of motion picture. Basically the process involved using a gif image which i got from google and taking screenshots of the starting motion and then another one of the finishing motion which you would then create separate functions for each screenshot within the same function system and connecting a button functionality to the system so on clicking the button, the screenshots change in a system of on and off.</p>
